# *Additional Notes:*

# You may be prompted to input your password more than once.

# Error handling will log errors and list errors at the end of the script but the script will continue to run even if an error occurs.

# Feel free to remove or add packages and software to suit your needs. Keep in mind the top-to-bottom order of commands. If you want a cask package, Homebrew needs to be installed first. Also anything being installed from the App store needs to excecute after 'mas' installation on line 44.

# Make sure you've logged into the App Store before running this script since 'mas' requires you to be logged in. If you're adding software to the script from the App store be sure to use the apropriate id number (App names do not work with mas).
