# Mac Development Environment Setup Script

Welcome to the Mac Development Environment Setup Script repository! This script is designed to automate the setup of a new Mac for development purposes. It's geared towards both experienced and novice developers looking to have a seamless setup experience. It installs all of my personal picks for the best packages, tools, and software when working on a Mac.

## Features

- **Automated Installation**: Automates the installation of essential tools, utilities, and applications to get you up and running quickly.
- **Customizable**: Easily add or remove applications to suit your needs.
- **Error Handling**: Detects and logs errors to ensure a smooth setup process.
- **Idempotence**: Run the script multiple times without causing unwanted side effects.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have administrative access to your Mac.
- Ensure you are logged into the App Store as some installations require it.

### Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nathan-kennedy/new-mac-setup.git
